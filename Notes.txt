Questions for Brian:
 - Passing location/uniform variables across classes/where should they be
 - Where to call drawElements from, each object? If so, why doesn't that work?
 - Passing programID around? Does it need to be done? If so, where?

Things to Do:
 - Object.cpp, make transormation matrices/vectors nicer + initalise them.
 - Make a game class to do everything main does atm and make main just call game.
 - Find out why view jumps the first time the mouse is moved.
